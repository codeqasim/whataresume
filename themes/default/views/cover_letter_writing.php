                                <br><br>
                                The resume's cover letter is one of the most important tools that are required in the quest for the perfect job. Cover letters can strengthen a basic resume while distinguishing the candidate from other prospects. Lastly, a cover letter establishes an active connection between the hiring authority and the candidate.

There are plenty of careers and resume services available, but what we've found is that instead of producing practical, effective resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and coaching services that deliver results, they sell job seekers on bells and whistles that simply don't matter to hiring authorities.</p>
